OSI Model, a complete overview:-
--------------------------------

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework
used to describe the communication functions of a computer or
telecommunications system. It consists of seven layers, each with a
specific function. Here's a simplified overview of the OSI model:

Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw bits over
a physical medium, such as copper wires, fiber optic cables, or wireless signals.

Data link layer: This layer provides error-free transfer of data frames between
two directly connected nodes over a physical layer. It includes functions such as
framing, error detection, and flow control.

Network layer: This layer handles the routing of packets between different networks.
It provides logical addressing and determines the best path for data to travel.

Transport layer: This layer ensures reliable, end-to-end communication between
applications on different hosts. It segments, reassembles,
and checks the integrity of data streams.

Session layer: This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication
sessions between applications. It provides services such as synchronization,
checkpointing, and recovery.

Presentation layer: This layer translates data from the application format into a
standard format that can be understood by other layers. It deals with data encryption,
compression, and conversion.

Application layer: This layer provides services directly to the end-user application.
It includes protocols for email, file transfer, remote access, and other network
applications.
