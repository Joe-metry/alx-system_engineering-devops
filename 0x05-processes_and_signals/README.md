A Simplified Explanation of project:
------------------------------------

In a computing system, a process is an instance of a running program.
It consists of an executable program, its data, and the resources
and memory allocated to it by the operating system.
Processes are fundamental to the functioning of modern operating
systems, and they provide a way for multiple programs to run
concurrently on a computer system.

Signals, on the other hand, are a way for processes to communicate
with each other and with the operating system. A signal is a software
interrupt delivered to a process, which can be used to notify the
process of a particular event or to request that the process perform
a particular action. Signals can be generated by the operating system,
by another process, or by the process itself.

Signals can be used for a variety of purposes, including process
management (such as stopping or terminating a process), inter-process
communication (such as signaling a process to perform a specific action),
and error handling (such as notifying a process of a segmentation fault
or other error condition).

Overall, processes and signals are important concepts in the world of
computing, and they play a crucial role in the functioning and management
of modern operating systems.
