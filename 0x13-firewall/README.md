Firewall, A concise Overview:
-----------------------------
A firewall is a network security device that filters and controls network traffic.
It acts as a barrier between a network and the internet, enforcing access control policies.
Firewalls monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access and potential threats.
They examine packets based on predefined rules, including IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Firewalls provide network security by preventing unauthorized connections and protecting against malicious activities.
They can detect and block known attack patterns, and some offer additional features like VPN support and NAT functionality.
Firewalls play a vital role in protecting network integrity and ensuring secure communication.
