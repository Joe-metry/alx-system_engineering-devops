Application servers overview:
-----------------------------


Application servers are software platforms that host, manage, and process web applications.
They handle incoming requests from users, execute code, and communicate with databases.
Application servers provide services such as load balancing to distribute traffic, security
features, and session management for user interactions. They are compatible with various
programming languages and frameworks, accommodating apps created in Java, Python, Ruby, and more.
Prominent examples include Tomcat for Java, Gunicorn for Python, and Unicorn for Ruby.
These servers often complement web servers like Apache or Nginx.
They offer tools for scalability, high availability, and monitoring, simplifying the deployment
and maintenance of dynamic web applications.
