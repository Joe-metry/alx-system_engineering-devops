Task Overview on Secure Shell:
------------------------------


SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure and encrypted
communication between two computers. It provides a secure channel over an
unsecured network, such as the internet. SSH enables remote access to a
computer system and allows users to execute commands on a remote machine
as if they were directly interacting with it.

Key features of SSH include authentication, confidentiality, and integrity
of data. It achieves this through encryption techniques and public-key
cryptography. SSH ensures that data transmitted between the client and
server cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

SSH is widely used for various purposes, including remote administration,
file transfers, and tunneling of other protocols. It is commonly employed
by system administrators, developers, and network engineers to securely
access and manage remote systems, regardless of the operating system.

Overall, SSH provides a reliable and secure means of remote communication
and system administration, protecting sensitive information from
unauthorized access and ensuring the privacy of data exchanged between
client and server.
