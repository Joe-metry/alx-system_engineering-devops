Brief Overview of Project:
--------------------------


Network Basics: Network basics refer to the fundamental principles and components of
computer networking. It includes concepts such as IP addresses, protocols (like TCP/IP),
routers, switches, and firewalls. Understanding network basics is crucial for building
and managing computer networks.

Server: A server is a computer or a system that provides services or resources to other 
computers or clients on a network. Servers can be dedicated hardware machines or software
applications running on a computer. They are designed to handle specific tasks such as
file storage, database management, web hosting, or application hosting.

Web Server: A web server is a specialized type of server that delivers web pages and other
content over the internet. It receives requests from clients (web browsers) and responds
by sending the requested files, which are typically HTML, images, CSS, or JavaScript.
Popular web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a system that translates domain names (e.g., example.com)
into IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1). It acts as a phonebook of the internet, allowing users
to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of numeric IP addresses.
DNS also handles other tasks such as email routing and domain registration.

Load Balancer: A load balancer is a device or software component that distributes incoming
network traffic across multiple servers to ensure efficient resource utilization, improve
performance, and achieve high availability. It helps prevent overloading of a single server
by spreading the workload across multiple servers, often in a clustered or redundant
 configuration.

Monitoring: Monitoring refers to the practice of observing and collecting data about various
aspects of a system, such as its performance, availability, and security. Monitoring tools
and techniques help administrators track system health, detect issues or anomalies, and make
informed decisions to optimize performance and troubleshoot problems.

Database: A database is a structured collection of data stored and organized in a way that
enables efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation. Databases are used to store and
retrieve data for various applications and systems. Common types of databases include
 relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra),
and in-memory databases (e.g., Redis).

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol
 used for transferring data over the web. It ensures that the communication between a web
server and a client (such as a web browser) is encrypted and secure. HTTPS uses SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to establish
a secure connection, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering.
