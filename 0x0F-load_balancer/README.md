Load Balancers:
---------------

	Project Overview:
-------------------------


A load balancer is a device or software that evenly distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources.
It helps optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and ensure high availability of applications or services.
By distributing the workload, a load balancer reduces the chances of any single server becoming overwhelmed,
thus improving overall system efficiency and preventing downtime.
