A Brief Overview of SSH/RSA usage:
----------------------------------

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to establish a secure, encrypted
connection between two computers. RSA is a type of public-key encryption
algorithm that is commonly used for authentication and securing
communications in SSH.
============================================================================
To use SSH with RSA authentication, you will need to follow these steps:

Generate an RSA key pair: This can be done using the ssh-keygen command,
which will create a public and private key pair in the ~/.ssh directory.

Copy the public key to the remote server: This can be done using the
ssh-copy-id command, which will add your public key to the authorized_keys
file on the remote server. Alternatively, you can manually copy the public
key and add it to the authorized_keys file yourself.

Connect to the remote server: This can be done using the ssh command,
specifying your private key with the -i option. Once connected, you will
be prompted for your password or passphrase (if you set one).

Using RSA authentication with SSH provides a more secure way to connect
to remote servers, as it eliminates the need for passwords to be transmitted
over the network. Additionally, it allows for easier automation of remote
tasks, as authentication can be performed automatically using the private key.
