What Happens When You Type 'www.google.com' on your Browaer and press enter:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, your browser
initiates a series of steps to access the website. First, it sends a request
to the DNS server to translate the domain name "google.com" into an IP address.
The DNS server responds with the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser
to establish a connection with the Google server.

Once connected, your browser sends an HTTP request to the Google server, specifying
the desired webpage or resource. The server processes the request and generates an HTTP
response, which contains the requested webpage along with additional information like status
codes, headers, and cookies.

Upon receiving the response, your browser renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files included in
the response, displaying the webpage's content and structure. Any images, videos, or other media embedded
in the webpage are also retrieved and displayed.

Throughout this process, the connection between your browser and the Google server remains secure if HTTPS is
enabled, ensuring the encryption of data transmitted between the two.

In summary, typing "google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter triggers a series of steps involving DNS resolution,
establishing a connection with the server, exchanging HTTP requests and responses, rendering the webpage, and ultimately
presenting the Google search page in your browser.
