This is a continuation of Web stack debugging 1.

Webstack debugging, also known as full-stack debugging, refers to the process of identifying and resolving issues or errors in all layers of a web application's technology stack. A web application's technology stack consists of several components, often categorized into front-end, back-end, and infrastructure layers. Debugging the entire stack involves investigating problems across all these layers to pinpoint and fix issues affecting the application's functionality and performance.
