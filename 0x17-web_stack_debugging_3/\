Project Overview:
-----------------

Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues that occur in the various layers of a web application's technology stack. This stack typically includes the frontend (user interface), backend (server and database), and the communication between them. Debugging involves isolating problems, understanding their root causes, and applying solutions to ensure the smooth functioning of the web application. It often requires a combination of technical skills, tools, and problem-solving techniques.
