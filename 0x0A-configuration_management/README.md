A Brief Overview on Configuration Management:
---------------------------------------------

Configuration management is a practice in software engineering and system administration
that focuses on managing and controlling changes to software systems, hardware devices,
and other IT assets throughout their lifecycle. It involves capturing, organizing, and tracking
configuration items (CIs) to ensure consistency, reliability, and maintainability of a system or product.

The main goals of configuration management include:

1. Configuration Identification: Identifying and documenting the configuration items
within a system or product. This includes hardware components, software modules, documentation,
and related elements.

2. Configuration Control: Establishing controls and processes to manage changes to the configuration items.
This involves evaluating proposed changes, approving or rejecting them, and maintaining version control.

3. Configuration Status Accounting: Keeping track of the status and history of configuration items, including
their versions, releases, and modifications over time. This helps in understanding the current state of the
system and the changes made throughout its lifecycle.

4. Configuration Auditing and Verification: Conducting audits and verification processes to ensure that the actual
system configuration matches the intended or documented configuration. This helps in identifying discrepancies, inconsistencies, and errors.

5. Configuration Baseline: Defining a stable configuration baseline that serves as a reference point for
system development, testing, and deployment. It represents a known and controlled state of the system.

Configuration management practices are particularly important in complex systems where multiple components, versions,
and dependencies exist. By effectively managing configurations, organizations can improve traceability, reduce errors
caused by inconsistent or mismatched configurations, facilitate collaboration, and enable efficient change management processes.
