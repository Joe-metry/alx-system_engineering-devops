Regular Expression, a Concise Overview:-
----------------------------------------

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text
manipulation in programming. They allow developers to search, replace, and
extract specific text patterns from a larger body of text.

Regular expressions are comprised of a combination of characters, symbols, and
operators that define a search pattern.
Some of the most common regex syntax includes:

Character classes: These allow you to match any character from a specific set,
such as [a-z] for any lowercase letter or [0-9] for any digit.

Quantifiers: These allow you to specify how many times a character or character
class should appear, such as * for zero or more occurrences or + for one or
more occurrences.

Anchors: These allow you to match patterns at the beginning or end of a string,
such as ^ for the start of a string or $ for the end of a string.

Alternation: This allows you to match one of several possible patterns,
such as using the | operator to match either "cat" or "dog".

Regular expressions can be used in a variety of programming languages, including
Java, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. They are particularly useful for tasks such
as data validation, parsing text files, and extracting data from web pages.
However, regular expressions can be complex and difficult to read, so it's
important to use them judiciously and to test them thoroughly
