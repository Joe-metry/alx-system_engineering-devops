A web server is a software or hardware system that serves as the foundation of the internet.
It responds to requests from clients (web browsers) and delivers web pages and resources over
the internet using the HTTP protocol. Web servers store and process files like HTML documents,
images, videos, and scripts to make them accessible to users. They enable the hosting and
publication of websites and web applications, ensuring secure and reliable content delivery
 Web servers handle various types of requests and support programming languages for dynamic
content. They can implement caching, load balancing, and encryption for performance,
scalability, and security. Web servers handle authentication, logging, and customization through
configuration files. They integrate with databases for dynamic data storage and retrieval.
Ultimately, web servers are vital for the functioning of the World Wide Web, facilitating the
exchange of information and resources globally.
